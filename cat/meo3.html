                        <h3>Product Information</h3>
                        <h4>Origin</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Maine Coon cat is descended from the American wildcat with amazingly sharp hunting ability. That is why looking at us will see a wild beauty, to be admired for its strength, agility and specialness.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>According to the studies of those knowledgeable about animals, today's Maine Coon cat is descended from the Norwegian forest cat or the Ankara cat. The Ankara cat breed followed Europeans to explore the Americas, thereby mating with native cats, after a rather complicated breeding process to create today's Maine Coon cat.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>However, there are other theories about this cat breed. For example, there are those who think that the origin of the Maine Coon cat is related to an English captain - Captain Coon, who commanded a trading ship. It was this ship that brought the Maine Coon to mate with local cats in many areas along the New England coast.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Characteristics </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Maine Coon cat is a wild cat that specializes in hunting, so to this day, even though they have been domesticated, they still have a rather large body. When mature, a Maine Coon cat can weigh up to 11kg, while the body is usually about 30 to 35cm tall. There are even mutant cats that can grow up to 1m tall, they look even bigger than a dog.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Maine Coon cat's coat is quite thick and long because it originates in harsh and cold weather areas. However, this becomes a disadvantage that makes them difficult to be popular in tropical countries with hot and humid climate all year round like Vietnam. In terms of coat color, the Maine Coon cat has quite a variety of coat colors, such as gray, white, yellow, ebony, navigator, etc. The coat is mixed between many colors but mainly cool tones. giving the Maine Coon a rugged and formidable appearance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Maine Coon cat has a rather large head, with a long mane around the neck like a lion. They have a large but short, slightly upturned nose. The ears are triangular, always erect and very sensitive to even the smallest sounds thanks to many sensitive hairs inside. The tail of the Maine Coon is very long and ruffled due to the thick hair, when they attack the tail will stand up menacingly.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The four legs of the Maine Coon cat are very large and strong, allowing them to run very quickly and accelerate when needed to hunt effectively. Maine Coon's toes are very clear, the feet look like the segments of a mangosteen fruit, very cute.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Characteristics of the Maine Coon cat's personality</h4>
                        <p>Next, let's find out with pet Osin about the personality of this cat breed to see if they are as wild and cold as they seem.</p>
                        <h5>Superior hunting ability</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Coming from a true predator, the Maine Coon has the ability to attack and destroy ingrained prey. When in the wild there are many small animals that will have to be wary of them, but when raised as a domestic cat you will be surprised with the ability of Maine Coon to catch mice.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Very smart and agile</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Maine Coon cats have instinctive intelligence, so they quickly adapt to changing living conditions. When raised as a domestic cat, the Maine Coon will be more agile than other cat breeds, adapt and understand the rules of human life, and quickly integrate. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>So the training is also quite simple, usually you only need to teach them a few times and they will remember. The things the owner forbids to do Maine Coon will also very obediently follow. When there is a Maine Coon cat in your family, you will be surprised by the intelligence of the animal, the process of raising them to become a member of the family will also be simpler and gentler than other pets.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Maine Coons are very active and agile, they love to run and play, like to be in large spaces. So you can play with them all day without getting bored, you can also buy cat toys to let them find joy when you are busy.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Kind, close and friendly</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Maine Coon cats have lived with humans for hundreds of years, so their wild and aggressive personalities have also been almost completely domesticated. They are becoming closer and gentler. They are also quite attached to their owners, like to be petted and cuddled like other cats. In addition, they also have a very clear distinction between prey and friends, so even if they share a Maine Coon cat with smaller, weaker pets, they will not attack without reason. That way you can also save a headache when your pets live in harmony with each other.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Loud and very alert</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Derived from the inherent intelligence, the Maine Coon cat is also highly alert. With strangers they will always keep their guard up, especially if they feel threatened or trespassing on their territory. Therefore, the Maine Coon cat is more useful than most other ornamental cats, not only knowing how to eat and sleep, lying in one place, but also being able to look after the house very well. When sensing danger, they will call out loudly to warn, and can even actively attack the enemy.</p>
                            </li>
