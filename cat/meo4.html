                        <h3>Product Information</h3>
                        <h4>Origin</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Ragdoll is known as the most famous and rare breed of pet cat in the world today. They first appeared at Ann Baker, around the 60s of the 20th century. Found by an expert Persian cat breeder.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The process of breeding to create Ragdoll cats is quite complicated from many different cat breeds. The first is from a beautiful female cat named Josephine, after an unexpected accident she underwent genetic experiments, creating unique genetic structures. It was discovered that the cat Josephine gradually became more docile, friendly and obedient. When she was cured of the disease, Josephine began to appear soft when someone picked her up, and her personality became more and more gentle. Ann Baker then decided to name the breed, established certain standards for the Ragdoll and fought a lot to get the breed recognized. By 2002, the Ragdoll was finally recognized by the world as a separate breed, with its own personality and characteristics.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Characteristics </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Ragdoll cats have a large body compared to the usual size of cats, at first glance their body is round and chubby. Their proportions are quite balanced, evenly large from the head to the end of the tail. Ragdoll cats weigh from 5.5 to 9kg in male cats and 3.5 to 7kg in female cats. Their neck and belly have very distinct lines of fat, but this is a trait of the species, not an indication that they are overweight.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Ragdoll cat has a big head, lovely round face. The high and pink nose, two upright triangular ears, large round blue eyes that are very attractive, occupying most of the face are the attractions of this cat breed. Ragdoll cat's mustache is very long, each time sniffing the mustache will move continuously very cute. The body is large, but the Ragdoll cat has 4 strong and strong legs, so their gait is very steady and firm.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The lifespan of a Ragdoll cat is about 12 to 17 years, depending on living conditions and care, they can live up to 20 years. The more you take care of them, the healthier they will be and the longer they will live.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Personality Traits of the Ragdoll . Cat</h4>
                        <h5>Kind and Loving</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Unlike other cats that love to run and play, the Ragdoll cat was born with a gentle, docile nature and is very obedient to the owner. Many people believe that these are traits inherited from Siamese cats. and Persian cats. However, many places that breed Ragdoll cats do not want them to be too gentle and soft, so they have tried to limit and change these personalities.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>To this day, Ragdoll cats are loved not only for their beautiful and lovely appearance, but also for their gentle personality, considerate and affectionate gestures. Other ornamental cat breeds such as British Shorthair, British Longhair, and even domestic cats, when growing up, will gradually become haughty. But Ragdoll cats are completely different, the more attached to their owners, the more tangled and braided they become, so they are also called with a very lovely name "puppy-cat". </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Every day, as long as you are at home, they will always follow every step. From place to place, the round chubby body seems to roll behind you, what could be cuter than that, right? They are always looking for a way to climb on you, to be petted, to be cuddled. In the eyes of Ragdoll cats, there are almost only friends, they do not like to play games nor do they like to play around, normally only like to do two things, one is to lie still on the floor, and then to run in your footsteps. Therefore, the Ragdoll cat is always very popular with all family members.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Get along with other pets</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Ragdoll cats are not only friendly with humans, but also get along well with other pets in the family. They are not selfish and jealous animals, so even if you cuddle another pet they won't react badly. If your family has a small space, they can also live peacefully without fighting.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>However, because of its gentle nature, the Ragdoll cat is not good at defending itself. They are easily bullied by other pets, so keep Ragdolls with gentle animals. In addition, they should not be left to play alone for too long, they are often not good at assessing the situation, do not know what is a dangerous situation. They can even cross the road without looking back and hurt, so if you don't supervise them, they will injure themselves without knowing it.</p>
