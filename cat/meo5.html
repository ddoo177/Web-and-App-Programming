                        <h4>Origin</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Siamese cat is a cat breed with a long history, there is no reliable and recognized information about the true origin of this cat breed. However, most opinions suggest that the Siamese cat appeared around the 14th century and originated in the country of the golden temple - Thailand. However, there is controversy that the Siamese cat actually appeared first in Europe. It was later introduced to the United States around 1879 and known to many people, gradually becoming popular. These two opinions are still arguing and no organization has confirmed, let's wait and see the exact origin of the Siamese cat.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In the 1960s, when strict requirements for the origin of cats were introduced, the Siamese was at a disadvantage because of its unclear origin. By 2000, this cat breed had reached the standard, began to be bred and raised widely, becoming a pet in many households. The crossbreeding of Siamese cats with other cat breeds also creates a unique and special generation of crossbreeds. Gradually, when it comes to ornamental cats, we cannot forget the position of Siamese cats.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Characteristics </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Siamese cats have a very eye-catching and attractive appearance, first of all, the body size. They have an average body length of about 29 to 35cm, weight from 3 to 5kg, this is a fairly average size and quite common in cats. They are slim and their body length exceeds their height, so they look very slim, agile, moving gently and attractively.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Their heads are long and tapered from ear to mouth, giving them the shape of a diamond. The lines are very harmonious and soft. Their mouths are quite pointed and small, their noses are small and wet, and the ears are erect with the base of the ears quite wide. Overall, the face of the Siamese cat clearly shows agility, intelligence and a bit of aristocracy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Eyes are the most attractive point in Siamese cats. The eyes are almond-shaped, big, round and bright, so they have a lot of depth, so when you look directly at them, it's like you're looking at a starry sky. Their irises are usually blue, or some other, less common color. In the dark the eyes will shine like sparkling jewels.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Siamese cat's coat is quite short and thick, a distinctive feature compared to other ornamental cats. Normally, ornamental cats will have long and soft double-layer coats, but Siamese cats have only one layer. The most common coat color in Siamese cats is beige on the body, and the tail and face will usually be black. There are also other coat colors such as white mixed with black, white mixed with gray, cream yellow mixed with black, blue mixed with white, etc. The more special and difficult to find, the Siamese cat will cost more.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Personality traits of Siamese cats</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The appearance of the Siamese cat can easily give us a feeling of coldness and aloofness, but in fact their personality is not at all like that. They are quite warm, cute and friendly to humans. Like most other cat breeds, Siamese cats love to be petted, caressed, loved to attract attention to their owners and loves to coddle.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>They are also very intelligent and agile, with excellent hearing, sight and smell. Therefore, training a Siamese cat will not be too difficult, just be a little patient and they will absorb everything you want to teach: go to the toilet in the right place, eat in the right place, don't play with things, ...</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Another special feature of Siamese cats is that they are not lazy like other ornamental cats, but on the contrary are very active, like to have fun running and jumping. So you can spend all day playing with them without getting bored, because they like to exercise, their health is also very well maintained, less disease is also less likely to happen obesity, overweight.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Siamese cats are not only gentle and obedient to their owners, but also to strangers or other pets. Even if you are not familiar with them, you can still easily pet them, for the Siamese cat to play with children, you do not need to watch too closely because the gentle nature of the Siamese cat rarely scratches or bites. With other pets in the family, too, Siamese cats are not aggressive, jealous or competitive, so they will usually live in harmony. However, you also need to consider choosing for them friends to live with that are gentle and harmless, because Siamese cats sometimes do not know how to protect themselves against attacks from other people or animals.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Siamese cats used to be raised as a symbol of god in Thailand, it's surprising that they are so friendly and cute. If you are considering whether to choose a Siamese cat as a family pet, the answer is definitely yes. This will be the loveliest companion you can find among the multitude of popular pets these days.</p>
