                        <h4>Where did the Poodle come from?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Poodle, also known as the Duck Hound, is the next generation bred from the French Water Dog, Barbet and Hungarian Water Hound. Compared to its ancestors, the Poodle has a much smaller, more beautiful shape. Therefore, they are raised mainly for the purpose of ornamental and pets.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In different countries, Poodle has a different name. The name Poodle comes from the German word "Pudel". This word translates to "diver" or "water dog". The reason it's so called is because the Poodle has an excellent swimming ability. This behavior is inherited from the previous generation of parents. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In France, people use the word Caniche to call this breed. This name comes from their hunting ability. Before being known as the pet dog it is today, the Poodle was trained to serve duck hunting, directions, and even military purposes. </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Distinctive features of this dog breed</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The ancestors of today's Poodle breed were very large in appearance. They have 4 legs and a very long neck that is suitable for their running and jumping characteristics. Because of that, they are trained as hunting dogs in many places. Experiencing many crossbreeding, at present, the Poodle has a petite appearance with an average body weight. Many strains are very small in weight, like Chihuahuas.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <p>Most Poodle lines today have short legs, but that does not affect their ability to run and jump.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The benefits of owning your own Poodle</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Contrary to the small body, the Chihuahua is a quite strong, lively and energetic dog. They are very attached and close to their owners, always in need of attention and care. They often have many actions to show intimacy such as licking their faces, running around their feet or close behind their owners, etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Try to imagine, after a tiring day of work, there is always a "little friend" waiting to come home and look at you with sparkling, affectionate eyes. Surely, all feelings of loneliness and fatigue will be reduced, right? Many people choose to nurture and take care of Poodle as a hobby and hobby to relieve pressure in life. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Not only that, many people even consider Poodle as a friend, a child to take care of. This is because this dog breed is very close and loyal to people. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Moreover, what dog lover does not want to own a puppy with a lovely, lovely appearance and lively personality? But Poodle certainly satisfies all of the above conditions. When you have a Poodle in your house, sometimes just looking at them is enough to make you feel happy.</p>
