                        <h4>Origin</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>No one knows when exactly Grass dogs appeared, because throughout history they have been with us. From wartime to peacetime, from watchdog to mighty hunting dog. All over Vietnam we see their appearance, with diverse appearance and size. Among them, Phu Quoc dog is the first Vietnamese grass dog recognized in the world with its own name.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Co Dog is not the name of a dog breed with similar genes and characteristics, but is the common name of purebred, unadulterated dogs of Vietnamese origin. Referring to Co dogs, we will think of the 4 most popular dog breeds: Lai Dog, H'Mong dog, Bac Ha dog and Phu Quoc dog.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Most families in Vietnam have a grass dog to look after the house. In rural areas, they are more common and much loved for their rustic closeness, ease of rearing, and ease of care. Although they do not have outstanding beauty like imported dogs, they are typical for life in Vietnam for many generations.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Characteristics </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>In each region, each breed of dog will have different appearance characteristics. Because of the living conditions as well as the growth process, even crossbreeding between Grass dog breeds also makes them more and more diverse. But in general, when it comes to Co dogs, we will remember the following characteristics</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Most of the grass dog's body is quite elongated, the length will exceed the height, creating a harmonious and flexible overall. Medium stature, height between 45 and 65cm and weight between 10 and 25 kg. Male dogs will usually be slightly larger than females.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Usually the Grass dog breeds have a small, elongated face that is balanced with the body size. The snout is quite long, with a black nose tip, and has a very good sense of smell. The head structure will usually be triangular in shape, looking very smart and agile. The tongue is long and pink, if there are spots on the tongue, it will be considered very intelligent.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Grass dogs have diverse coat colors, short lengths are also different in each breed. For example, the Bac Ha dog has a very distinctive ruffled and ruffled coat, while the Lai dog has a short coat that hugs the skin. Regarding the color of the Coyote, the most common color is yellow, in addition to colors such as jet black, white, spotted, brindle, fire red, brown, etc. </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Grass dog personality traits</h4>
                        <p>Grass Dogs do not have a special appearance that cannot be compared with imported dog breeds. But what makes them attractive is their special and respectable personalities.</p>
                        <h5>Loyalty and obedience</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Grass dogs have been kept in families for thousands of years. They are raised, cared for, cared for and loved, gradually forming a gentle and loyal nature to their owners. They will follow your orders quickly and absolutely. With proper training, they will become a perfect sentinel bodyguard.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Loyal and attached to the owner, close and safe with even small children, but the Coyote is still highly wary of strangers. If they see someone entering the house they will bark very loudly, when the enemy has behavior that makes them feel threatened, they may attack first to protect property and owners.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Intelligence</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Are Grass Dogs as smart as pet dogs? Yes, definitely yes, even the Grass dog is considered one of the smartest dog breeds. They live with humans for many generations, they are exposed to the way of life of society, are taught and gradually adapted to perfection. Therefore, the Coyote dog always has a certain cunningness, correctly assesses the situation, feels when the owner is sad to comfort, when scolded, he will lower his ears to show remorse, ...</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>It is this intelligence that makes the connection between the dog and the owner extremely strong. Raising a Grass dog you will never feel lonely or lost. They even know how to catch mice instead of cats, but they often pounce on chickens, ducks, and small family pets, causing many funny situations to happen. Because Grass dogs are intelligent but they are animals anyway, you should patiently guide and train them, do not let loose too much.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Dynamism</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Grass Dogs are very active. The body is supple, flexible and healthy, they have very good resistance, so daily exercise is a part of them to maintain health and activity. Grass dogs should not be locked or chained frequently and continuously, which will make them crazy, grumpy, and aggressive. Let them run around according to their preferences so that your dog is comfortable.</p>
