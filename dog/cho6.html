                        <h4>Origin</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Chihuahua is the oldest breed of dog in the Americas. The ancestors of the Chihuahua are from Mexico, the name Chihuahua is also named after a state in this country - where humans first discovered them. However, the person who is credited with making this breed known around the world is the Chinese.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Legend has it that, before Colombo set foot in the Americas, all Indians had a belief that: Chihuahuas had a close association with the sacred gods. Therefore, the Chihuahua was very respected in this period.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Chihuahuas were introduced to Europe in the last years of the 19th century through colonial discoveries. </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Outstanding Features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Chihuahua is one of the smallest dogs in the world. The average weight of a Chihuahua ranges from 1 to 3 kg and the average length ranges from 13 to 23 cm. However, connoisseurs of this breed agree that the most precious Chihuahuas usually weigh less than 1.3kg.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Despite its small body, the Chihuahua has a rather large head with pointed ears and a short muzzle. The most attractive feature on a Chihuahua's face is probably the eyes. They have large, round, black eyes that sparkle like rubies. In addition to the mysterious black color, there are also those with dark red eyes that are very rare.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The top of the puppy's head will have a soft breathing tip covered with fur. This is also the weak point on the Chihuahua's body, unable to bear the impact of too strong force. As the puppy matures, this breathing tip will be covered by the skull bone and become stronger.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Chihuahuas have sharp and pointed teeth that make them easy to bite through. At the same time, this is also an extremely effective self-defense weapon. Chihuahua body length tends to be larger than height. In addition, they also have a short tail that is often bent or swept to the side.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Chihuahuas have quite a variety of coat colors. Their coat can be pure one color or can be mixed between two or three different colors. The most common coat colors in this breed are: sandy yellow, light brown, steel blue, chestnut brown, orange yellow mixed with white, black mixed with white, ... This breed is divided into two main types: long-haired Chihuahua and long-haired Chihuahua. Short-haired Chihuahua. In terms of overall appearance, these two types do not have too much difference. The most prominent feature that distinguishes them is the plumage. However, the short-haired Chihuahua is more popular and preferred in Vietnam.</p>

                        </ul>
